 * - This header file will contain board related settings for different boards.
 * - Each board configurations are put in its own header file, like emsk/emsk.h
 * - If you want to change the configuration, you need to go to related header file, e.g.
 *   if you want to change EMSK board settings, you need to go to emsk/emsk.h
