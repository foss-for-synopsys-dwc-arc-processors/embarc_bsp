ARC Timer Interrupt Example
###########################

Overview
********

 This example is designed to show how to use |arc| internal timers and timer interrupt.

Detailed Description
====================

 * Extra Required Tools
      NO

 * Extra Required Peripherals
      NO

 * Design Concept
    This example is designed to show how to use ARC timer and interrupt.
    During initialization, the timer 0 and timer 1 are enabled and interrupt is configured. The timer 0 Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is set as Fast Interrupt Request Queue (FIQ) using ``int_pri_set()``. The timer 0 interrupt is responsed with the highest priority.

.. note::
    Hardware support: all |arc| based platform with internal timers configured

Building and Running
********************

Taking |emsk| as exmaple, the commands to run this example are as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd <embarc_root>/example/baremetal/arc_feature/timer_interrupt
    $ make BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d TOOLCHAIN=gnu run

.. note:: Make sure you have selected the correct configuration of |emsk| via dip switches and that you have reset the board (button above “R”).

Sample Output
=============

If you are using the ``nSIM``, you will see the following outputs in the CMD window when download is successful.

.. code-block:: console

If you are using the |emsk|, you will see the same msg through UART

.. note:: Make sure you have chosen correct COM port and set the baud rate to 115200 before you start.
