Adding a New Board
##################

This section describes the process to add a new board named ``myboard`` in embARC BSP.

1. Create a sub-folder under ``board`` folder and named ``myboard``. Create two new files ``myboard.mk`` and ``myboard.h`` in this folder.

2. Create necessary sub-folders and files under ``myboard``. The BSP for ``myboard`` is made up of these sub-folders and files. There are 3 folders required, ``common``, ``config`` and ``drivers``.

	* ``common``: contains the common routines for ``myboard``. The ``board_init`` function and ``board_timer_xxx`` functions should also be implemented in this folder.

	* ``configs``: contains board configuration information, including

	        - ``target_memory.h`` file containing memory information
	        - ``*.tcf`` file containing information about the arc configuration, compiler options, etc.
	        - ``myboard_hardware.h`` file containing necessary hardware definitions, e.g., peripheral address, interrupt number assignments, etc.
	        - ``*.mk`` files, to be included in ``myboard.mk`` with required build system information.
	        - any other required files

	* ``drivers``: contains on-board driver implementations for ``myboard`` board

3. Modify ``myboard.mk``.  Add necessary information in
   ``virtual.mk``, such as source folders, include folders, object output
   folders and make rules. The build system will automatically compile all the
   source files (``.c``, ``.s``) in the added folders and finally create a library named
   ``libmyboard.a``.

4. Modify the ``myboard.h`` and add it into ``board.h``. ``myboard.h`` is the
   only place where board specific information should be exposed, e.g., function
   declarations, hardware definitions, macros.

.. note::
   For details, please refer to other existing board support folders such as ``<embARC>/board/emsk`` for reference.
